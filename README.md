# Flight Delays Analysis

## Project Overview  
Airport arrival performance is significantly impacted by weather conditions, leading to flight delays and operational inefficiencies. This project explores patterns in flight delays and visualizes key insights using R.  

## Objective  
- Investigate how weather impacts flight delays.  
- Identify patterns based on carrier, destination, and scheduled departure times.  
- Use histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and pie charts for analysis.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** R  
- **Libraries:** dplyr, ggplot2  
- **Dataset:** FlightDelays.csv  

## Key Questions Explored  
- Do scheduled departure times influence delays?  
- How do weather conditions correlate with flight delays?  
- Which days of the week experience the most delays?  
- Are certain airlines more prone to delays?
